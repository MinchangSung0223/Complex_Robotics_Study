# Chapter 2. Kinematic manipulability of general mechanical systems
### 2.1 Introduction
 - **General kinematic model** wich considers all degree of freedom and then imposes the constraints as **algebraic conditions**
 - **General static force balance model** which can be considered as a dual of **the differential kinematics**
